Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering refers to the application of engineering principles in the creation, operation, deployment and maintenaince of software systems. The process involved in software engineering revolves around the SDLC life cycle (requirements, design, implementation, deployment and maintenance)

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Engineering refers to the application of engineering principles in the creation, operation, deployment and maintenaince of software systems. It is a structured process which aims at meeting the user needs whie traditional programming is not structured. This is to mean that it doesnt follow specific processes. It focuses more on the coding part than the meeting user needs.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
SDLC refers to the processes involved in the creation and maintenance of software.
1) Requirements - This stage involves the gathering and analysis of the requirements which will be used in the development of the software. A document is drawn to note them down.
2) Design - Involves creating the design documents and archictecture to showcase how to meet the requirements. A model of the software can be drawn too to "create" a picture of the intended software.
3) Implementation - This is where the actual coding takes place. It entails transforming the design into executables.
4) Testing - THis involves verifying that the software meets the user needs specified at the beginning and it works as intended.
5) Deployment- this is making the software available for the end users in the production environment.
6) Maintenance - THis can involve updating the software when necessary, fixing bugs when it fails etc


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall model is a sequential approach which means that the next process depends on the complention of the previous. It is unexecutable unless the previous is done which can be a very slow process. Water fall also demands that the  requirements be stipulated before hand. This is best ideal for projects that have a well defined plan. Where everything is defined from the start and the uncertainity is very low. 
where else
Agile model uses an incremental approach. The start of a phase isnt well dependent on the previous process, which makes it very flexible to use. Customers are also able to give feedback after a phase is complete and corrections can be made at the timeinstead of waiting to deliver the product after completion. THis leads to low errors unlike in the waterfall model. THis is best suited for projects where the requirements are not defined as changes may be required along the way. 

while waterfall requires requirements speficied at the start agile doesnt. Waterfall is also sequential while agile is iterative. waterfall also focuses on the process and documentaion while agile is about colaboration and people


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering refers to the process of defining, analysing and documenting of the requirements needed for the software. THis process aims at ensuring the development cycle is smooth as all the requirements that will be needed at clearly stated and analysed to ensure they are clear.

THe process involves collecting information from the stake holders or the clients through either interviews, surveys or observation. Then they are analysed to ensure they are feasible. THen documentation is done after often using diagrams or models. Lastly, validation is done to ensure that they are achievable and that they meet the needs stipulated.

The process is important in SDLC as it ensures the product will meet the user needs. it also provides a clear road map through out the development cycle which will in turn prevent any misunderstanding along the way.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity refers to the process of dividing the software into distinct modules which can be manipulated independetly. When modules are created, they make it easier to undertstand and modify without affecting the entire system. Changes can be made there and later intergrated into the system. THey also improve performance where by one can add and delete features independetly and intergrate later. Lastly, they allow for reusability across different projects which reduces the time required.


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Testing in development ensures that the product is of quality and it meets the specified needs and standards. THrough testing, errors and defects are identified and corrected before the product is released. It aslo reduces the risk of failure after deployment which saves on the cost or repair required.

Unit testing is testing individual units (can be components or functions) independently to ensure they work okay
Intergration involves testing integrated components to ensure they work together as expected. 
System testing involves testing the entire system as a whole also to ensure it works efficiently.
Acceptance testing is testing done by end users to ensure the software is per their needs.


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

VCS are tools that help to host the source code and track changes of it over time.  They are important as they allow collaboration among developers giving them the chnace to work on the same project simultanously. THey also support branching and merging of projects. THey maintain history of the changes made allowing tracking and auditing. 

Examples include Git which intergates with Github/ Gitlab. supports forking, cloning, branching & merging.
Mercurial which is similar to Git but focuses more on the scalabity and performance.


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

A project manager "manages" the project during its development. They oversee its planning, implementation and deployment all the while making sure needs are met. THey also make sure it is completed on time and within the allocated budget and the quality is top notch.

Some of their key responsibilites include planning, communicating to stakeholders, scheduling the time scoop, overssing the budget for the project, coordinating the team members, and mitigating risks that they araise within the project.

Challenges: ensuring collaboration among the team members, sticking to the allocated time frame, balancing the allocated budget, handling unforseen issues and managing chanaging requirements. 


Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software manitenance involves modifying software after deployment so it adapts to the changing environment and requirements. It can involve correcting faults and improving its perfomance. 

It is an important part of the cycle as it enhances performance and boosts security. It also ensures that the software remains functional and relevent after deployment over time : Hence extending its lifespan. It also makes sure to address user feedback

Corrective maintenance- fix errors and bugs
Adaptive - modifying it to "Adapt" to the new environment
Perfective - enhacing functionality based on the feedback
Preventive - improving software to prevent future issues


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Privacy - ensure user data is protected 
security - implement strong security measures to prevent cyber attacks
transparency - telling your users honestly about the strengths and weeknesses of the systems
Being bias - ensure your algorithms are not discriminative

Ethical Standards
Accountability: take responsibility for the impact of their work
Priotize user needs in making decisions
adhere to the code of ethics like the ACM
